											<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I am Iqra. I would describe myself as honest, spontaneous and committed. In my spare time I like to go on adventures , out for food, socialising with friends and helping those in need. My goal in life is to become a highly skilled female developer who will encourage more women from backgrounds like mine to join the IT industry.    </p>

								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<h3>Gathering Requirements</h3>
										<p>I worked as part of a team to develop a COVID-19 Tracker for a general medical practice. We had to have various team calls with the stakeholder to ensure the project would be delivered on time with little to no issues. A set of requirements were created and signed by the Stakeholder. A few wireframes were created to outline the design of each webpage.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>Project Execution</h3>
										<p>We used Github to make sure we were all working on the most upto date version of the code. I used JavaScript frameworks such as React.js and Node.js to create a webpage that displayed a set of COVID-19 statistics. These statistics were pulled from a DB and were presented in the form of widgets. Also, the page had the funtionality to print the statics as a report in PDF and Excel format. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>Final Product</h3>
										<p>There were many challenges one of them being COVID-19, social distancing restrictions. This meant that stakeholder meetings were not done in person and a lot of our team collaboration was done online. Our final product was delivered on time with a lot of positive comments made about the overall functionality of the tracker. </p>

									<h2>Cubic Transportation Systems</h2>
									<p>I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Cubic, as part of my placement year at University.</p>

										<strong>BI Development</strong> 
									</li>
									
								</ul>
								<p class="content">I worked as part of an operations team where I worked on a development project using LAMP stack. I worked with the business to modify an existing website that was used by engineers to store historic records as well as input their daily tasks. The role required me to code in PHP, HTML, Javascript and SQL with Github being used for version control. During my placement, I used PowerBI to create visualisations that outlined the performance of the GOC(Global Operations Centre). This allowed me to manipulate and transform a large amount of data with the aim being to create a set of insights that could be used by higher management.   </p>

									<h2>Sage</h2>
									<p>I worked as a Graduate BI Developer at Sage.</p>
									<p>I joined Sage as a Graduate BI Developer as I had been given a little taster during my year in industry but was left quite curious about BI. Consequently, I was asked to create a report that could be implmented and accessed in Confluence. I used the ETL process to create a report using PowerBI and Snowflake. I was introduced to Informatica which was a data integration tool which I used to transform data in an agreed format from the business to customers. This required me to use SQL Server/MySQL to troubleshoot and fix any data issues that were reported by the business or customers.    <br />
